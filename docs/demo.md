You can currently sign up to use a shared, on-line demo of searchrefiner. This demo will be slower than using an instance installed locally or at an institution level, because there may be many other concurrent users. Please register for an account at the following address:

<div class="flex three one-600 ">
    <div>
        <article class="card">
            <footer class>
